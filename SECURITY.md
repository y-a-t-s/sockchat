# Security Policy

**NOTE: This is not a place for reporting general bugs. Use Issues for that purpose.**

**If you have a reasonable suspicion the problem could be exploited by a malicious actor, this is the right place to report it. If you are not sure, err on the side of caution.**

## Supported Versions

Please confirm that you have pulled the latest commit before sending.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, you can use either the private reporting feature I have set up for this repository or send me a PM on the Farms.


Please provide as much information as possible so I can locate the vulnerability, reproduce it, determine severity, and fix it.

Use of PGP is not required and I won't yell at you if you don't use it in private report, but I highly recommend becoming familiar with using it. GnuPG is not as intimidatingly complex as it may seem.

The above PGP key is the same one used to sign all of my (y-a-t-s) commits. Any changes to it should only be trusted if made in a **verified (signed)** commit by me.
Key changes will also be announced by me in a status on my forum profile.
The commit signing key is set in my account settings and requires a lot of verification to change. If, God forbid, I need to change it, that will be the first place I do so.
